            <Passage>What a season it has been. From happiness to heartbreak, all 8 teams made it to the finish line. Some
            won the ultimate prize, while others fell well below their expectations. Lets go over how every team did this year.</Passage>

            <StyledMiniHeader style={{marginBottom: "0"}}>8th Place: <span style={{ color: "#9900FF" }}>Trocean</span></StyledMiniHeader>
            <Passage>This outcome was pretty expected across the league. The two managers, who had collectively seen one
            PMBL game before the draft and were given the team less than 24 hours before it had a rough season. The old
            management left the franchise in much a disarray, however this management should be here to stay. Despite
            tying the same record as the old management, signs of improvement were greatly shown despite the new managements
            lack of experience. They were blown out more often then not, but they did get fairly crucial wins down the stretch
            to shakeup the playoff race, especially the 5-4 comeback win against THANdrew and a win over division winner Isaac.
            With a season of experience under their belt, head manager Ocean and assistant manager Troy will look to improve on
            the dreaded 3-7 record this franchise has continued.</Passage>

            <StyledMiniHeader style={{marginBottom: "0"}}>7th Place: <span style={{ color: "#6AA84F" }}>Marge</span></StyledMiniHeader>
            <Passage>What a disaster of a year for this franchise. Many people forget that Matt in Season 1 started 2-0. Since then,
            the franchise has been 5-13. It started on a high note beating Trocean in the 11th inning in Week 1, but quickly fell
            apart. From the trashing on the Daisy Cruiser and one of their "associates" getting banned from the stadium, to
            reports of their training practices with their players getting leaked, it was a very disappointing year, after what looked
            to be a promising co-manager hire. Peach was a really rough captain pick for this team, known for having one of
            the worst batting percentages throughout the season. Boo had a rough year on the mound while King Boo and Hamburger had
            career years. Their high points were a 7-run comeback against Morgan and a league shocking 10-4 victory against eventual
            champion Justave. This season had lots of downs for Marge, with a few ups sprinkled in. Now with manager George having
            some experience they hope to bounce back next year. </Passage>

            <StyledMiniHeader style={{marginBottom: "0"}}>6th Place: <span style={{ color: "#CC0000" }}>Brendan</span></StyledMiniHeader>
            <Passage>An incredibly frustrating and perplexing year for Manager Brendan. The best record in the league last year fell
            to 0-3 right out of the gate, just barely losing Week 1 and then his pitcher throwing for his former lover in Week 2
            by giving up 10 runs in the 1st. Momentum was gained in the middle of the season winning 3 of 4, with 2 of those being
            nail-biting games, but would eventually fall off against in the few final weeks before a meaningless win in Week 10 to
            finish 4-6. The biggest issue for this season for Brendan was pitching. Despite getting the 1st pick and hopeful
            about his hitting core, he forgot to remember that theirs 3 aspects to baseball, and pitching and fielding were neglected,
            which costed him a game or two. Bowser and Boomerang Bro were the highlights yet the rest of the team was fairly mediocre.
            The only thing this team will be remember for was the trade with James, giving away the speed in the outfield for more
            hitting and pitching. Blooper was by far the best pitcher Brendan had to offer, winning Most Improved Player, yet he wasn't
            perfect and the outfield was still very disappointing for obvious reasons. Having the 3rd ranked offense was good
            but the 6th ranked defense was what hurt the franchise this year, after having the 1st ranked defense last year.
            </Passage>

            <StyledMiniHeader style={{marginBottom: "0"}}>5th Place: <span style={{ color: "#999999" }}>THANdrew</span></StyledMiniHeader>
            <Passage>This team was one Boo item, two blown 1-run leads in the 7th, and an crucial error away from being 9-1. Yet
            they missed the playoffs at 5-5. A collapse worse than Isaac's 3-1 to 4-6 last year, THANdrew was 4-1, coming off beating
            the undefeated powerhouse James, and being the #1 seed halfway through the season, to falling to 5-5 and missing the
            playoffs. You can't make this stuff up. A team that had ZERO chemistry in its batting lineup, known for their incredible
            defense, couldn't get the job done. Despite having the 3rd ranked defense (1st for most of the season), their offense
            was 6th, the inverse of Brendan's offense/defense rankings. Only scoring a point more than 3-7 Trocean this year, their
            biggest win was by 5, and their biggest loss was by 4. One of the most entertaining teams to watch due to how close their
            games were, with 3 of their games being given nicknames due to how good they were. THANdrew also became the first team
            to ever play a Noki, and Green Noki saved the game in Week 1 against Isaac. Their biggest issue was Blue Kritter. A reigning
            Defensive Player of the Year who had multiple errors (including the one to lose in Week 10) and was absolutely horrible
            at the plate, posting the 7th worst batting percentage, and 2nd worst for a player who played every game. This will
            be the second consecutive year that Manager Andrew has coached a 5-5 team that has barely missed the playoffs due to
            tiebreaker with Morgan.</Passage>

            <StyledMiniHeader style={{marginBottom: "0"}}>4th Place: <span style={{ color: "#FF00FF" }}>Morgan</span></StyledMiniHeader>
            <Passage>What looked to be a very lost season starting 1-4, and blowing a 7-0 lead to Marge, Morgan made some changes
            to his roster. He finally made the change to annex Yoshi, who had blown 2 games for him, to bring in old manager
            Diddy Kong and Reshiram. This changed helped Morgan go 4-1 in the 2nd half of the season, and including overcoming
            his own 7 run deficit in Week 7, to steal the final wild card spot away from THANdrew. Despite not winning in the
            Conference Series, Morgan once again made it competitive like last year, becoming the first team to tie the series
            1-1 after the first 2 games. He would go on to get shutout the next two games, losing the series 3-1 to Justave. King K
            Rool was an incredible disappointment in that series except for Game 2. Morgan's outfield for the 2nd half of the
            season was the best in the league, with the babies and Yellow Yoshi having incredible speed. Its crazy to think how
            Morgan and THANdrew have both been 5-5 the past 2 seasons, yet one has made the playoffs both years, while the other
            has just barely missed out due to losing to the other. Morgan is 4-0 against THANdrew all time. </Passage>

            <StyledMiniHeader style={{marginBottom: "0"}}>3rd Place: <span style={{ color: "#3586E8" }}>Isaac</span></StyledMiniHeader>
            <Passage>After the collapse of last year, Isaac, while not happy about it, decided to bring in the Monkey team,
            led by Donkey Kong. However, he decided to not choose Diddy Kong, instead bringing in Paragoomba. After a rough
            loss Week 1 to THANdrew, Isaac's defense was the star of the show this year after having a record breaking offense last
            year, winning 7 of their next 8 games, with their only loss against Justave. Isaac would become the first and still only
            team from the West division to have an above .500 record, winning the division after the Week 9 win against Morgan.
            Going into the playoffs as the #2 seed with MVP Funky Kong, the team unfortunately hit a very tough opponent in James.
            Despite beating them 11-9 earlier this season at DK Jungle, Manager Isaac's team would get swept, losing each game by an
            average 8.67 runs. A devastating way to go out despite the 7-3 record. Rookie Justin Nascimento was an absolute vital
            piece to his pitching game, with an undefeated record in the regular season, but mightily struggled against bigger,
            non-West division competition, and will be missing the entirety of next season undergoing Tommy John surgery. The big
            question around this team is whether Diddy Kong would have made this team a champion. Paragoomba played one game and
            was the only player who finished with a .000 batting percentage. </Passage>

            <StyledMiniHeader style={{marginBottom: "0"}}>2nd Place: <span style={{ color: "#F1C232" }}>James</span></StyledMiniHeader>
            <Passage>Despite reaching the World Series again, it was a roller coaster of a year. James became the first team to
            start 4-0 with an absolute record breaking offense. His smallest margin of victory came in Week 2 by 5 runs. He won 2 games
            in this stretch by 15+ runs. But then, he decided to trade with Manager Brendan, trading away core hitting part Blue Pianta
            in order to get better fielding. This would culminate in back to back losses, including a blown save to THANdrew in the
            final inning to get his 1st loss. This trade completely changed the team, as James stopped going to Daisy Cruiser caused
            he didn't have as much hitting power. He would blow another save to Isaac in Week 8, known as The Error Game, in which
            Yellow Pianta would give up multiple runs with only 1 out needed to win. Falling to 6-4 from 4-0, he would lose out on
            the division once again. He would regain his steam for the playoffs, sweep Isaac, and even take Game 1 in the World Series,
            but would eventually lose it, due to another blown save in Game 2, the atrocious amount of errors his fielding would have
            in Games 3 & 4, and Petey Piranha absolutely falling apart in Games 2 & 3. The dynasty would not come to fruition, and a
            repeat champion was denied. The trade was by far the most pivotal moment in the James team history, completely changing the
            formula he was used to having from all hitting to needing more defense. The league is curious to see what path he will
            take next season.</Passage>

            <StyledMiniHeader style={{marginBottom: "0"}}>1st Place: <span style={{ color: "#FF9900" }}>Justave</span></StyledMiniHeader>
            <Passage>Predicting the team with the last pick in the draft and drafting a player who was convicted of crimes against
            his new teammate to win it all would have sounded crazy at the start of the season. With Justave getting out to a 1-2 record and
            only scoring 9 runs, including a 5-12 loss to Morgan, in the first 3 games was a rough look. But once Koopa came back from
            suspension, things completely changed for this franchise, going from a horrific offense to scoring 15+ runs in 4 games,
            the magic from James was transferred to Justave. Bob Marley went from being a good pitcher to being an absolute elite pitcher.
            Since starting for manager Brendan last year in Week 2, when Bob Marley starts a game, the team is 14-5 in the regular season.
            Other than an embarrassing loss to Marge, this team was practically flawless through the rest of the regular season. The
            leagues best defense once again took the top seed in the playoff bracket. Justave would become the first #1 seed to lose a
            game in the Conference Series, however that didn't matter in the end, winning both the Conference Series and the World Series
            in 4 games, culminating in the franchise's first ever title. Despite the championship victory, this team was drenched in
            controversy throughout the entire year, from drafting Koopa, to paying off a reporter to write an article saying how good
            their training regiment is, to the manager threatening players and their families. While this team might not be the most
            liked across the league, it was by far the most interesting. Only having 2 true power hitters, and one of the best pitchers
            this league has seen in Bob Marley, this was a surprising year, being almost the complete opposite from what James did
            to win the season prior.</Passage>
